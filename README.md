## Problem setup

In this assignment you are asked to apply ANNs in order to classify a given silhouette (image) of a vehicle as one of four types
- a double decker bus (class 0),
- Opel Manta 400 (class 1),
- Saab 9000 (class 2),
- Cheverolet van (class 3),

using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles. The dataset is given in two files: veh_train.csv and veh_test.csv. Variable class is the outcome (nominal) variable.
One of the principal questions of this assignment is whether PCA can help (or, at least, not make worse) predicting classes.
